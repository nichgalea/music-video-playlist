# Music Video Player

Built with:

- TypeScript
- React
- Redux
- Webpack
- SASS

Run `npm start` after installing dependencies and the application will launch on http://localhost:9000

This will load and embed videos from YouTube in the form of a playlist.

Add videos from the form at the bottom and delete videos from the playlist itself.

The playlist is persisted to `localStorage` and the Redux state is rehydrated from it.
